## Material

This project is developed with material components. In order to have a proper theme, we had to override the default 
theme from [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/).

You can have more informations on this [here](https://material-ui.com/customization/themes/#theme-configuration-variables).

## Victory

In order to visualize data in the way we want, we used [Victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory) 
which is very useful.
